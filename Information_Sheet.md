&#x20;   **1. Introductory statement:**

&#x20;       a. Researcherâ€™s Name:  Dr. Vivek Nallur

&#x20;       b. University College Dublin

&#x20;       c. School of Computer Science

&#x20;       d. Detecting Cognitive Biases Using Conversational Agents.

&#x20;   **2. What is this research about?**

The objective of this study is to determine the if cognitive biases can be detected through the utilisation of conversational agents, specifically chatbots in the domain of public transportation. Given that cognitive biases are inherent in all human beings, our aim is to examine planning data across diverse tasks acquired during the experimental process. The overarching goal is to assess the capability of a conversational agent to consistently identify the presence of a specific cognitive bias, namely the status quo bias, framing effect, without the requirement for human input.

&#x20;   **3. Why am I doing this research?**

This study aims to investigate the potential utilisation of chatbots for assessing human cognitive biases. The overarching objective is to discern the role of these biases in impeding human performance and contributing to suboptimal decision-making. The ultimate aspiration is to leverage technology to mitigate such biases and enhance decision-making outcomes. The research endeavours to contribute insights into the mechanisms by which this can be achieved.

&#x20;   **4. How will your data be used?**

The data will be employed to determine the viability of using chatbots for the measuring specific cognitive biases such as Status Quo Bias and framing. The outcomes will be presented in a summarized format intended for institutional and academic purposes, ensuring that individual identification is rigorously safeguarded.

&#x20;   **5. What will happen if you decide to take part in this research study?**

Participation in this research is entirely voluntary and confidential. You will be required to review and consent to an online agreement form (following this message). Should you choose to participate, the information you provide through survey completion may contribute to the objectives of this research. You have the option to refrain from answering any questions you find undesirable.

&#x20;   **6. How will I protect your privacy?**

Should you opt to participate in this research endeavour, a distinctive identifier code will be assigned to you, serving as a substitute for your name in all data records. Consequently, all gathered data will be rendered anonymous, with no means for identification. Stringent measures will be implemented to securely store and archive the data upon the culmination of the research period. The processing of your data will adhere to the provisions outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and the Data Protection Act 2018.

&#x20;   **7. What are the benefits of taking part in this research study?**

Participating in this research offers no immediate personal advantages; however, it plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding, aiding researchers in the development of more tailored systems to combat biases. This contribution serves the greater benefit of society.

&#x20;   **8. What are the risks of taking part in this research study?**

The potential risks associated with participation in this research are minimized; however, it is important to note that the survey records the conversation made with the chatbot on a given task. The primary risk is related to data leakage. Rigorous measures have been implemented to ensure the security and robust protection of your data (Conversation with the chatbot) during interactions with the chatbot. Participation in this research is entirely voluntary, and there are no penalties for choosing not to take part. Importantly, non-participation will not have any adverse effects. Given that the data is collected anonymously, it is emphasized that responses cannot be personally identified.

&#x20;   **9. Can I change my mind at any stage and withdraw from the study?**

Participation in this research is entirely voluntary. Should you choose to engage, you retain the right to alter your decision and withdraw at any juncture before submitting the survey. Your data will not be utilized under any circumstances if you opt to withdraw. There are no repercussions for abstaining from participation or withdrawing at any stage throughout the survey. It is crucial to note that, given the anonymous nature of data collection, once you click submit, there is no means to retract your data, as we lack the capability to identify individual responses.

&#x20;   **10. How will I find out what happens with this project?**

To stay informed about the progress of this project, please maintain communication with the principal investigator, Dr. Vivek Nallur. It is anticipated that certain outcomes of the research will be disseminated through publications, and you can contact Dr. Nallur to receive notifications regarding these developments. It is assured that any publications resulting from this study will exclusively employ anonymized data, ensuring the confidentiality of all participants. A concise overview of the research findings will be accessible on Dr. Vivek's research website at [https://viveknallur.github.io.](https://viveknallur.github.io.)
